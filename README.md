## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Applying the knowledge I've learned to making this was hard as I don't know explicitly how to go from scratch, so all I could've done was trial and fail. Besides, getting the right measures for each component was also challenging.
I feel like there's still a lot more for me to learn.

    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;

}
```

### Continued development

These challenges are great for someone who wants to try out their newly-consumed knowledge of front-end development, so I'll continue to engage in these.

It first got really hard so I kinda checked out a few solutions. Then I see it's not that hard.
